# STOR 767 Advanced Machine Learning

This repo contains my solutions to homework of the course [STOR 767 Advanced Machine Learning](http://yfliuteach.web.unc.edu/stor767/) at UNC-Chapel Hill, and some exercises in the textbook: [The Element of Statistical Learning: data mining, inference, and prediction,](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf) by Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2009). LaTeX for theoretical questions and R markdown for computational questions.
